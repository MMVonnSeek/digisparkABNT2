# digisparkABNT2

The objective of this project is to make HID attacks viable using a digispark on machines configured to operate with abnt2 keyboards.

The file **scancode-ascii-table.h** must be placed inside the directory **C:\Users\USU√ÅRIO\AppData\Local\Arduino15\packages\digistump\hardware\avr\1.6.7\libraries\DigisparkKeyboard* *

Some characters still do not work, however it is already feasible to perform HID attacks.
UPDATE: THIS SITE WILL HELP PUT ALL THE MISSING CHARS http://kbdlayout.info/KBDBR/scancodes
